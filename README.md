Iris flowers belong to the genus Iris, which is a large group of flowering plants with over 300 species. These flowers are known for their distinctive, showy blooms and are popular in gardens worldwide. There are three main species of iris that are commonly cultivated: bearded iris, Siberian iris, and Dutch iris. Each species has its own unique characteristics.

Bearded Iris (Iris germanica):

These are the most common type of iris flowers. Named for the fuzzy "beard" on the lower petal. Bearded iris blooms come in a wide range of colors, including purple, blue, yellow, orange, pink, and white. Flowers typically have six petals: three upright petals called standards, and three drooping petals called falls. Bearded Iris

Siberian Iris (Iris sibirica):

Native to Europe and Asia, these iris plants are known for their slender, grass-like leaves. Flowers are usually smaller than those of bearded iris and come in various shades of blue, purple, and white. Siberian iris blooms have a different structure, with standards and falls that are similar in size and form. Siberian Iris

These are just a few examples, and within each species, there are numerous cultivars with different colors, sizes, and characteristics. Iris flowers are often classified based on factors such as bloom structure, color, and height.
